# zspcc 
## Objective
### Zero-shot Point Cloud Completion with 3D & 3D Priors

### 3D assest generationh from text/image/pc with a new representation (surface splatting)

## TODO
### A. Make surface splatting work (good point cloud, good image)
- scaling size/shape
- pruning & densification design
- repulsion and attraction
- Other priors
- read 2019 paper & follow up 
- know your 3d gaussian splatting
- what other representations are used for SDS? 

### B. Try depth map as rendering
- feed in the SDS framework
- fine-tune
